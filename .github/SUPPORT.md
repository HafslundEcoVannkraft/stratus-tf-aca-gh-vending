## ⚡ Response Times

We aim to respond to:
- 🐛 **Bug reports**: Within 2-3 business days
- ✨ **Feature requests**: Within 1 week
- 💬 **Discussions**: Within 1-2 business days
- 🔄 **Pull requests**: Within 3-5 business days

> **Note**: These are goals, not guarantees. Response times may vary based on complexity and maintainer availability.

## 🆘 Urgent Issues

For **security vulnerabilities** or **critical bugs**:
1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. **Email** the maintainers directly (check repository settings for contact info)
3. **Include** detailed information about the issue
4. **Wait** for a response before disclosing publicly

## 🎯 Getting Better Help

To get faster, more accurate help:

### ✅ **Do This**
- **Search existing issues** before creating new ones
- **Use issue templates** - they guide you to include important info
- **Provide examples** - show us your configuration
- **Include error messages** - copy the full error text
- **Specify versions** - Terraform, providers, OS
- **Be specific** - "doesn't work" is hard to debug

### ❌ **Avoid This**
- **Vague descriptions** - "it's broken" doesn't help
- **Screenshots of text** - copy/paste text instead
- **Multiple issues in one** - create separate issues
- **Demanding immediate fixes** - we're volunteers
- **Being rude** - kindness goes a long way

## 🌍 Community Guidelines

When asking for help:
- 🤝 **Be respectful** - treat others as you'd like to be treated
- 🧠 **Be patient** - maintainers are often volunteers
- 📚 **Do your homework** - try to solve it yourself first
- 🙏 **Say thanks** - appreciation motivates maintainers
- 🔄 **Pay it forward** - help others when you can
